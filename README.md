- 👋 Hi, I’m @harshkumarjangir
- 👨‍💻 I’m a full-stack web developer currently diving deep into the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Right now, I’m based in Jaipur and doing a full-stack development course at GRRAS Solutions Pvt Ltd, Jaipur, where I’m building on the skills I’ve picked up along the way.

- 👨‍💻 I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Applications from S. S. Jain Subodh P. G. (Autonomous) College in Jaipur. Over the years, I’ve developed a passion for web development, especially front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and libraries like React.js, along with frameworks like Bootstrap, MDBootstrap (MDB) and Tailwind CSS. I’ve also started using Redux for state management to help keep everything organized in larger applications.
